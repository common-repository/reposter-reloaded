Reposter Reloaded recycles your posts on a schedule of your choosing.
Reposter Reloaded will find the oldest post in a specific category, and re-date it with the current date and time.
It does this on the schedule of your own choosing or randomly, which can be as frequently as every 6 hours or as spread out as 21 days.
